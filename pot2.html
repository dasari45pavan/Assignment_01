    BEAST PIRATES<br><br>

    The Beasts Pirates[2] are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew led by their governor-general, Kaidou, formerly one of the Four Emperors. They were based in Wano Country, specifically headquartered on Onigashima.[3][4]

For the past 26 years, the Beasts Pirates consolidated their power in Wano, which they occupied through an alliance with the country's shogun, Kurozumi Orochi.[3][5] Within the past three years, the crew partnered with Donquixote Doflamingo and Caesar Clown to create artificial Zoan Devil Fruits called SMILE Fruits, leading to the crew having over 500 users with Devil Fruit powers. After the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance captured Caesar, destroyed the SMILE Factory and defeated Doflamingo, Kaidou turned to a new alliance with the Big Mom Pirates. The two Emperors' alliance planned to conquer the world by obtaining the Ancient Weapons and the One Piece.[6] Part of this plan is Kaidou's "New Onigashima Project", which sought to replace Orochi as shogun with Yamato during the latest Fire Festival.[7]

This scheme ultimately failed, as during the Raid on Onigashima, all their top officers, alongside his fellow Emperor Big Mom, were defeated one after another by the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance and Kaidou himself was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy, captain of the Straw Hat Pirates.[8] After the battle, Kaidou was sent flying down into an underground magma chamber and was caught in a massive volcanic explosion,[9] while the fates of most of the remaining members are unclear.

As a result, Kaidou was no longer considered as one of the Four Emperors following the announcement of his defeat, leaving the overall status of the Beasts Pirates unknown, although the vast majority were eventually captured by Marines.

Due to their actions and role, they are the main antagonists of the Zou Arc and Wano Country Arc, and one of the central antagonist groups of the Whole Cake Island Saga and Wano Country Saga.
