 RED HAIRED PIRATES<br><br>

 The Red Hair Pirates are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew ruling in the New World, captained by their chief, Red-Haired Shanks, one of the Four Emperors and a former apprentice of the Roger Pirates.

The Red Hair Pirates are the first pirate crew to appear in the manga and the second to appear (next to the Alvida Pirates) in the anime. They are the main influences of both Luffy and Usopp's journeys, the former being inspired by Shanks and the latter being motivated to become a great warrior of the sea by his father Yasopp, a member of the crew.
