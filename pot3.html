    STRAW HATS<br><br>

    The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are an extremely infamous and powerful pirate crew under the captaincy of Monkey D. Luffy that originated from the East Blue.

First referred to with this moniker by Smoker in Arabasta,[13] the crew made its way through the first half of the Grand Line within a year of Luffy beginning his pirating career, rapidly becoming more infamous and attracting powerful enemies and allies alike. Luffy, as well as his right hand Roronoa Zoro, were both recognized as Super Rookies with bounties of over Beli100,000,000. However, following a total defeat in the aftermath of the Celestial Dragon Hit-and-Run Incident, the crew was separated by Bartholomew Kuma and Luffy made the decision to have them train separately for two years to increase their strength for the New World.[14] The crew successfully reunited after this time and reached the New World, where they have continued in exploits sending shockwaves throughout the world. As founding members of the Ninja-Pirate-Mink-Samurai Alliance, they played a central role in the overthrow of Kaidou and Big Mom of the Four Emperors, and following this Luffy was recognized as one of the Emperors.[15]

Of their many allies, the Straw Hats are most prominently tied to the Straw Hat Grand Fleet whose members officially professed their service to Luffy during the Dressrosa Arc, giving the crew over 5600 subordinates at their command if necessary.[16] Each Straw Hat member under Luffy is officially recognized as a Senior Officer of the Grand Fleet.[17]

The crew sailed on the Going Merry,[18] their first official ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship, which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg.[19]

Being led by main protagonist Luffy, they are the central protagonist group of the manga and anime One Piece.
